         The compression level defines how rigorously the compressor looks
         to find the longest string possible. As a general rule of thumb:
         - Compressing at the maximum level (9) requires around twice as
         much processor time as compressing at the minimum level (1)
         - For typical input, compressing at the maximum as opposed to
         the minimum level adds around 5% to the compression ratio.
         0 value means no compression.
